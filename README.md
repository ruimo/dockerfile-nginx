dockerfile-nginx
================

# Dockerfile for nginx + monit + ssh

Both ssh and nginx are monitored by monit and will be automatically restarted once they are aborted.

# How to use:

* You need to prepare your own Dockerfile having at least two lines inside:
```
--- Your Docker file ---
FROM ruimo/dockerfile-nginx
MAINTAINER <your name>
<EOF>
```

* The following files are needed to build you Dockerfile:
```
 authorized_keys: Used as public key for ssh access.
```

* If you want to tweak nginx and monit configuration.
 Their configuration files reside in /etc/nginx and /etc/monit/conf.d respectively. Modify them in your Dockefile.

* Build your image by ```docker build```.

* Run your image by ```docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 22:22 <your image id>```
 Of course, you can change port number as you like. You can login ssh by user 'nginx'. The initial password is 'password' excluding quote. Since the account is set expired, you will be forced to change initial password.
